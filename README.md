# Arduino-Car-Ardujimmy
This project is an arduino car using NRF24L01 and L298N with working NRF24L01 library. With development. You can modify and develop by yourselves for your own project for personal use or commercial. All free. You can ask me if you have any question about it.

All components:

1. Receiver:
- Arduino nano 328p 5v
- Nrf24l01 with diy 3.3v breakout (using AMS1117 3.3v with Pin Header)
- Battery 7.4v (18560) with box
- T-gear Yellow DC Motor
- 2 Pin Switch
- L298N Motor driver
- Cables & Jumpers
- DIY Brackets

2. Transmitter:
- Arduino minicore 328pB 5v (I use this since I have no other boards. You can use 168p or 328p promini, nano, uno, etc.)
- Nrf24l01 with 3.3v breakout
- Battery 7.4v (18560) with box
- Cables & Jumpers
- Analog Joysticks

All above is minimum, you can develop it using toggle switch, potentiometer, led, servo, camera, etc which I will include in my Github rep for you for free. So, don't forget to Subscribe bro: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ardujimmy" title="ArduJimmy">Subscribe ArduJimmy Youtube Channel</a>
